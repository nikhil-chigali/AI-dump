## The Empirical Rule (or) Three-Sigma Rule (or) 68-95-99.7 rule
states that for a normal distribution, (where $\mu$ is mean, and $\sigma$ is standard deviation)
1. 68% of the data falls within the first standard deviation from the mean. $(\mu \pm \sigma)$
2. 95% of the data falls within the first two standard deviations from the mean $(\mu \pm 2\sigma)$
3. 99.7% of the data falls within the first three standard deviations from the mean $(\mu \pm 3\sigma)$

> [!example]
> If the data follows a normal curve, the $\mu$ is 20 and $\sigma$ is 0.5, then,
> 1. 68% of the data falls between
> >   $(\mu \pm \sigma) = (20 - 0.5, 20 + 0.5) = (19.5, 20.5)$
> 2. 95% of the data falls between
> >   $(\mu \pm 2\sigma) = (20 - 2\times0.5, 20 + 2\into0.5) = (19, 21)$
> 3. 68% of the data falls between
> >   $(\mu \pm \sigma) = (20 - 0.5, 20 + 0.5) = (19.5, 20.5)$
