## The Empirical Rule (or) Three-Sigma Rule (or) 68-95-99.7 rule
states that for a normal distribution,
1. 68% of the data falls within the first standard deviation $(\sigma)$ of the mean $(\mu)$ ➡️ $(\mu + \sigma)$
2. 95% of the data falls within the first two standard deviations of the mean $(\mu + \sigma)$
