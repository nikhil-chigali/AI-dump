## Normalization
It is a scaling technique method in which data points are shifted and rescaled so that they end up in a range of 0 to 1. It is also known asÂ **min-max scaling**.

$\large X_{normalized} = \frac{X-X_{min}}{X_{max}-X_{min}}$

Data Normalization properties:
- Useful when the distribution of data is unknown or not Gaussian
- Sensitive to outliers
- Retains the shape of original distribution
- May not preserve relationship between the datapoints

## Standardization
Standardization is another scaling method where the values are centered around mean with a unit standard deviation. It means if we will calculate mean and standard deviation of standard scores it will be 0 and 1 respectively.

$\large X_{standardized} = \frac{X-\mu}{\sigma}$  

Data Standardization properties:
- Useful when the distribution of the data is Gaussian or unknown
- Less sensitiv

Where, mean is $\mu$; and $\sigma$ is Standard Deviation
