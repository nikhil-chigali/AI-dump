## Expected Value
If we sample a data point (x) at random, we expect it to be around the population average $\mu$, give or take one standard deviation $\sigma$

The **expected value** of one random draw is the population average $\mu$

What about $\bar{x_n}$, the average of *n* draws?
The expected value of sample average, E(\bar{})
