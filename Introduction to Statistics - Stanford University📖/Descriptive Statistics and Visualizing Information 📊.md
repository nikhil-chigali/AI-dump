Ways to summarize data using numbers and graphs. Two most important functions of descriptive statistics are:
* Communicate information
* Support reasoning about data

## Pie chart and Dot Plot
For data that are *qualitative* (e.g., colors, car types, etc.), use a **pie chart** or **dot plot**

* The dot plot makes it easier to compare frequencies of various categories.
* The pie chart makes it easier to see what percentage of the total a category corresponds to.

## Bar graph
When the data are *quantitative* (i.e., numbers), they should be put on a number line. 
The **bar graph** is essentially a dot plot put on its side.

## Histogram
The **histogram** is similar to a bar graph. It allows blocks with different widths.

The areas of the blocks are proportional to frequency. There are 2 kinds of information drawn from a histogram:
1. **Density** (crowding): The height of the bar tells how many subjects there are for 1 unit on the horizontal scale.
	Ex: The highest density is around age 19 as $.04 = 4\%$ of all subjects are age 19. In contrast, only about $0.7\%$ of all subjects fall into each one year range for ages 60-80.
2. **Percentage** (relative frequencies): Those are given by 
	$area = height \times width$
	Ex: about 14% of all subjects fall into age range of 60-80, because the corresponding area is $(20 yrs) \times (0.7 \% per year) = 14 \%$ 

## Box-and-Whisker Plot (Box plot)
**Box plot** gives the following five-number summary:
	1. Minimum
	2. 25th percentile (1st Quartile)
	3. Median
	4. 75th percentile (3rd Quartile)
	5. Maximum

**Box plot** conveys less info than a histogram, but it takes up less space and is well suited for comparing several datasets:

This graph is an example of the `principle of small multiples`
Histogram depends on the intervals that we select for the blocks of data. 
In Box plot, the data is automatically divided into 4 quartiles.

## Scatter plot
The **Scatter plot** is used to depict data that come as *pairs*. It is useful to visualize the relationship between 2 variables.

## Providing context is KEY for Statistical Analyses 
Statistical analyses typically compare the observed data to a reference. Therefore, context is essential for graphical integrity. A great way of doing this is by **Principle of small multiples✨**
	A principle introduced by Edward Tufte. Small Multiples are small, thumbnail-sized representations of multiple images displayed all at once, which **allows the reader to immediately, and in parallel, compare the inter-frame differences**
The compact size of Box Plot makes it suited for this task:

Another example, with a time series plot:

## Pitfalls when visualizing data
*Sophisticated software makes it tempting to produce showy but poor visualizations
