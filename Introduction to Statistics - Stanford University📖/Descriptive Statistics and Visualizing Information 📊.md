Ways to summarize data using numbers and graphs. Two most important functions of descriptive statistics are:
* Communicate information
* Support reasoning about data

## Pie chart and Dot Plot
For data that are *qualitative* (e.g., colors, car types, etc.), use a **pie chart** or **dot plot**

* The dot plot makes it easier to compare frequencies of various categories.
* The pie chart makes it easier to see what percentage of the total a category corresponds to.

## Bar graph
When the data are *quantitative* (i.e., numbers), they should be put on a number line. 
The **bar graph** is essentially a dot plot put on its side.

## Histogram
The **histogram** is similar to a bar graph. It allows blocks with different widths.

The areas of the blocks are proportional to frequency. There are 2 kinds of information drawn from a histogram:
1. **Density** (crowding): The height of the bar tells how many subjects there are for 1 unit on the horizontal scale.
	Ex: The highest density is around age 19 as $.04 = 4\%$ of all subjects are age 19. In contrast, only about 0.7% of all subjects fall into one year range
2. **Percentage**
