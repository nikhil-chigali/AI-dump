Use mean and median for summarizing data with only one number.
* ***Mean** is simply the average of all the data points
* ***Median** is the number that is larger than half the data and smaller than the other half

Consider the following histogram, where area corresponds to percentage:

Median is marked at $50,000 where half the area of the histogram is below $50,000 and half the area is above it.

> [!note]
> Mean and Median are the same when the histogram is symmetric

A Histogram which is longer on the right is said to be *skewed* to the right. In such histograms, mean can be much larger than the median.
