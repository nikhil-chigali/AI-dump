Use mean and median for summarizing data with only one number.
* ***Mean** is simply the average of all the data points
* ***Median** is the number that is larger than half the data and smaller than the other half

Consider the following histogram, where area corresponds to percentage:

Median is marked at $50,000 where half the area of the histogram is below $50,000 and half the area is above it.

> [!note]
> Mean and Median are the same when the histogram is symmetric

A histogram which is longer on the right is said to be *skewed* to the right. In such histograms, the mean can be much larger than the median. 
A histogram which is longer on the left is said to be *skewed* to the left. In such histograms, the mean can be much smaller than the median.

**For such skewed histograms, it is better to use MEDIAN**

Median is simply the 50th Percentile of the data.

> **How would you describe the 25th percentile on the example of household income, if you know that the 25th percentile corresponds with a specific number X?**
	25% of the households have income less than X, and 75% of the households have income greater than X
