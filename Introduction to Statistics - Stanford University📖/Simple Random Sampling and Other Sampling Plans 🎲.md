Question: What percentage of voters approve of the way the US President is handling his job?
This is difficult to determine exactly as there are more than 250 million people of voting age in the US
But it's not difficult to *estimate* this percentage quite well:
	Sample 1,000 (say) voters at random. Then use the approval percentage among those voters as an estimate for approval percentage of all voters.

**Sampling correctly is very important**
It is very tempting to sample a 1,000 voters in your hometown
This is a **sample of convenience**. This is not a good way to sample because the voters will be different from the population of US voters.

This will introduce **BIAS**, i.e., this sampling will favor a certain outcome
* **Selection bias**: A sample of convenience makes it more likely to sample a certain subjects than others
* **Non-response bias**: Parents are less likely to answer a survey at 6 pm because they are busy with children and dinner
* **Voluntary response bias**: websites that post reviews of businesses are more likely to come from customer who had very bad or very good experiences and therefore feel strongly about writing a review.
