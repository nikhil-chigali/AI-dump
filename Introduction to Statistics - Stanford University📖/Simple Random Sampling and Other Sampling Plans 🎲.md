Question: What percentage of voters approve of the way the US President is handling his job?
This is difficult to determine exactly as there are more than 250 million people of voting age in the US
But it's not difficult to *estimate* this percentage quite well:
	Sample 1,000 (say) voters at random. Then use the approval percentage among those voters as an estimate for approval percentage of all voters.

**Sampling correctly is very important**
It is very tempting to sample a 1,000 voters in your hometown
This is a **sample of convenience**. This is not a good way to sample because the voters will be different from the population of US voters.

This will introduce **BIAS**, i.e., this sampling will favor a certain outcome
* **Selection bias**: A sample of convenience makes it more likely to sample a certain subjects than others
* **Non-response bias**: Parents are less likely to answer a survey at 6 pm because they are busy with children and dinner
* **Voluntary response bias**: websites that post reviews of businesses are more likely to come from customer who had very bad or very good experiences and therefore feel strongly about writing a review.

## Sampling designs
The best methods for sampling use chance in a planned way:
* a **Simple Random Sample** selects subjects at random without replacement
	* A popular way to use a simple random sample is *random digit dialing* in the olden days
* **Stratified Random Sampling** divides the population into groups of similar subjects called *strata* (e.g., urban, suburban, and rural voters). Then one chooses a simple random sample in each stratum and combines these.

## Bias and Chance Error
Since the sample is drawn at random, the estimate will be different from the parameter due to **chance error**. Drawing another sample will result in a different chance error.
	$estimate=parameter + bias + chance\_error$
**Chance error** (**sampling error**) will get smaller as the sampling size gets bigger. Moreover, we can compute how large the chance error will be (see [[later]]).
This is not the case for **bias** (**systematic error**):
Increasing the sample size just repeats the error on a larger scale, and typically we don't know how large the bias is.
Hence, we try to avoid bias by using *chance* in our sampling
