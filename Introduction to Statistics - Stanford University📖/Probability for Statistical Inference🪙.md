**Subjective Probability**: The likelihood of a particular event happening that is assigned by an individual based on whatever info is available.
	E.g., *There is a 30% chance that my best friend will call me.*

**Rule for equally likely outcomes**: If there are *n* possible outcomes, and they are equally likely, then **P(A) = (number of outcomes in A) / *n***

>[!example]
>Roll a die three times ðŸŽ². What is P(at least one 6)?
>We could write 'at least one 6' as follows:
>	6 on first roll *or* 6 on second roll *or* 6 on third roll   
>But these three events are **not** mutually exclusive, so we can't use the addition rule.
>Better way: Start with complement rule.
>P (at least one 6 in three rolls) 
>	= 1 - P(no 6 in three rolls)
>	= 1 - P((no 6 in first roll) *and* (no 6 in second roll) *and* (no 6 in third roll))
>	=  1 - P(no 6 in first roll) *x* P(no 6 in second roll) *x* P(no 6 in third roll)
>	= 1 - 5/6 *x* 5/6 *x* 5/6
