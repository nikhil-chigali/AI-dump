## Correlation Coefficient
Correlation is usually measured between two variables.
> [!note]
> Correlation doesn't mean Causation

Let's say the two variables we want to measure correlation for are $X, Y$
Where, 
	$X=[x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]$
	$Y=[y_1, y_2, \dots, y_n]$
Means and Standard deviations of the variables are as follows,
	$\large{\bar{x}, s_x, \bar{y}, s_y}$

A scatter plot visualizes the relationship between two quantitative variables.
It may have,
1. Direction (sloping up or down)
2. Form (a scatter that clusters around a line is called *linear*)
3. Strength (how closely do the points follow the form?)
