## Binomial Setting
If you read a question and each trial only has 2 outcomes (pass/fail, heads/tails, boy/girl, etc., ), it could be in a **Binomial Setting** if:
1. Each observation is either success or failure
2. There is a fixed number "n" observations
3. All observations are **independent**
4. The probability of success "p" is the same/constant for all the observations
> [!note]
> When determining if there is a binomial setting, the **independence** check can be tricky. 
> 	*If the population is 10 times greater than the sample size*, then we can assume there is independence in a random selection
