Unlike Normal Distribution $N(\mu,\sigma)$, Binomial Distribution $B(n,p)$ is a discrete random variable and can be solved for exact solution.
## Binomial Setting
If you read a question and each trial only has 2 outcomes (pass/fail, heads/tails, boy/girl, etc., ), it could be in a **Binomial Setting** if:
1. Each observation is either success or failure
2. There is a fixed number "n" observations
3. All observations are **independent**
4. The probability of success "p" is the same/constant for all the observations
> [!note]
> When determining if there is a binomial setting, the **independence** check can be tricky. 
> 	*If the population is 10 times greater than the sample size*, then we can assume there is independence in a random selection

## Binomial Distribution
1. $\mathcal{X}$ is defined as the number of successes
2. $n$ trials
3. $p$ probability of success
$\mathcal{X}$ can take on whole number values between 0 & n with a distribution of $B(n,p)$
### Binomial Coefficient
The Binomial coefficient gives us the number of "k" successes out of "n" observations
	Binomial Coefficient $= \comb{n}{k} = \large\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$
