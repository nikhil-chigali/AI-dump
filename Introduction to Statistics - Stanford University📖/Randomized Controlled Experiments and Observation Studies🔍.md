## Observational Studies
People who eat red meat have higher rates of certain cancers than those who don't eat red meat.
* This means that there is an **association** between red meat consumption and cancer: there is a link between these two.
* But this does **not** mean that eating red meat *causes* cancer: people who don't eat red meat are known to exercise more and drink less alcohol, and it could be the latter two issues that cause the difference in cancer rates.
This is an **observational study**: It measures outcomes of interest, and this can be used *to establish association*.

**ASSOCIATION DOES NOT MEAN CAUSATION** 
because there may be **confounding factors** such as exercise that are associated both with red meat consumption and cancer.

## Randomized Controlled Experiments
To establish *causation*, an experiment is required:
A **treatment** (e.g., eating red meat) is *assigned* to people in the **treatment group** but not to people in the **control group**.
Then the outcomes in the two groups are compared. To rule out confounders, both groups should be similar, apart from the treatment. To this end:
* The **subjects** are assigned into treatment and control groups at **random**
* When possible, subjects in the control group get a **placebo**: it resembles the treatment but it's neutral. Assigning a placebo makes sure that both groups are equally affected by the **placebo effect**: the idea of being treated may have an effect by itself.
* The experiment is **double-blind**: neither the subjects nor the evaluators know the assignments to treat and control.
Randomization serves two purposes:
* It makes the treatment group similar to the control group. Therefore, influences other than the treatment operate equally on both groups, apart from differences due to chance.
* It allows assessing how relevant the treatment effect is, by calculating the size of chance effects when comparing the outcomes in the two groups (see [[later]])
