## Conditional Probability

![[Algebra#Probability Rule 7 (Conditional Probability Rule)]]
This gives us the General Multiplication rule:
![[Algebra#Probability Rule 8 (General Multiplication Rule)]]

In the special case where A and B are independent, 
P(B | A) = P(B)
Hence, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)

> [!example]
> Given, 
> 	P(word 'money' appears in the email | email is *spam*) = 8%
> 	P(word 'money' appears in the email | email is *ham*) = 1%
> 	P(email is *spam*) = 20%
> What is the probability that 'money' appears in an email?
> P
