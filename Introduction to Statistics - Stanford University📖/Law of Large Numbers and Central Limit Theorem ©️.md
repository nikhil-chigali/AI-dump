[[Square Root Law⚖️]] states that $SE(\bar{x_n})$, the standard error of the sample mean, goes to zero as sample size increases.
Therefore, 
>[!info] Law of Large Numbers
>The sample mean $\bar{x_n}$ will likely be close to its expected value $\mu$ if the sample size is large. This is the **law of large numbers**

Keep in mind that law of large numbers applies,
1. for averages and therefore also for percentages, but not for sums as SE *increases* with sample size
2. for sampling with replacement from a population, or for simulating data from probability histogram
>[!note]
>In terms of the [[Expected Value, Standard Error, and Sampling Distribution of the Statistic📊#Three Histograms]]
>The law of large numbers state that the empirical histogram of the data (Histogram #2) will be close to the probability of probability histogram (Histogram #1) if the sample size is large
