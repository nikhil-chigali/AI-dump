### The importance of the square root law is twofold:
1. It shows that the SE becomes smaller if we use a larger sample size *n*. We can use the formula to determine what sample size is required for desired accuracy (Controlling magnitude of *SE*, using *n*)
2. The formula for the standard error **does not depend on the size of the population**, only on the size of the sample
Standard error ties back to the errors that we saw in random sampling, expressed as "$chance\_error$" (Refer [[Simple Random Sampling and Other Sampling Plans ðŸŽ²]])
