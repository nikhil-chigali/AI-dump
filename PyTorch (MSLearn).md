## Tensors
Torch tensors are Numpy arrays on steroids. These tensors are capable of automatic differentiation (using AutoGrad), and GPU acceleration.

## Data Primitives in PyTorch
`torch.utils.data.Dataset` - Stores data samples along with their labels `torch.utils.data.DataLoader` - Wraps an iterable around `Dataset` to easily access the samples
